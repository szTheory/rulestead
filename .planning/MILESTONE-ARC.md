# Milestone Arc: Post-v1.2.0

**Last updated:** 2026-05-24 during `gsd-complete-milestone`
**Selection posture:** Default to the highest-priority candidate below unless the user explicitly chooses a materially different direction. Shift low-impact milestone-selection preference left inside GSD instead of re-opening the full tradeoff set every time.

## Current Recommendation

- **Activate now:** `v1.3.0 — Guarded Rollout Foundations`
- **Why now:** Lifecycle and ownership are now shipped, so the strongest next differentiator is explicit guarded rollout behavior built on top of the calmer operator foundation instead of skipping ahead to broader reuse features.

## Candidate Ranking

### 1. `v1.2.0 — Lifecycle Hygiene & Ownership`

**Status:** shipped on 2026-05-24
**Why it won:**

- Solves daily trust and cleanup pain instead of later-stage scale pain.
- Fits the existing Elixir/Phoenix shape cleanly: metadata and lifecycle contracts in `rulestead`, mounted workflow and operator UX in `rulestead_admin`, host identity still host-owned.
- Builds directly on already-shipped code references, auditability, explainability, governance, and mounted admin seams.
- Matches mature platform lessons from Unleash, LaunchDarkly, GrowthBook, Flipper, and the local JTBD/persona docs: owner, lifecycle state, stale guidance, and safe retirement need to feel first-class.

**Recommended shape:**

- First-class ownership metadata and lifecycle defaults on flags
- Explicit lifecycle states and expected-lifetime guidance
- Archive-readiness guidance that combines code references, last evaluation, and lifecycle metadata
- Calm cleanup UX across CLI, docs, and mounted admin filters/workbench

**Key tradeoffs:**

- Strong operator value, lower marketing flash than guarded rollouts
- Easy to overbuild into noisy heuristics or a mini work-management system if not kept narrow

**Guardrails:**

- Keep runtime evaluation independent from lifecycle scans and ownership lookups
- Treat owner references as opaque host-owned metadata, not a new Rulestead identity model
- Keep lifecycle/archive guidance advisory; never auto-archive
- Preserve the linked-version sibling-package model and avoid standalone-admin drift

### 2. `v1.3.0 — Guarded Rollout Foundations`

**Status:** current recommendation
**Why it is next now:**

- High-value differentiator, but it depends on stronger operator trust, clear threshold semantics, and disciplined host-supplied signals
- More complex and more surprising if pulled left before the lifecycle/cleanup loop is fully credible

**Recommended shape if activated later:**

- Host-supplied rollout-signal behaviour seam
- Stage-level monitoring windows with explicit `hold` / `roll back`
- Audit-first explanation inside the existing rollout workflow

**Key tradeoffs:**

- Strong differentiation and release-safety story
- High risk of scope drift into observability product, anomaly detection platform, or standalone control plane

**Guardrails:**

- Keep metrics host-supplied; do not own telemetry backends
- Fail closed on stale, weak, or missing signal data
- Preserve deterministic sticky rollout semantics; never use time-based gradual rollout for user-facing rollout

### 3. `v1.4.0 — Reusable Targeting Assets`

**Status:** top medium-term candidate after guarded rollout
**Why it is later:**

- Solves scale and duplication pain, but not the biggest current trust/operability gap
- Introduces indirection across explainability, compare, promotion, import/export, and dependency visibility

**Recommended shape if activated later:**

- Shared audiences first
- Any templates remain draft-based, bounded, and non-inheriting
- Impact previews and reference counts before edits

**Key tradeoffs:**

- Good product leverage once operators have accumulated repeated targeting logic
- Easy to create blast-radius surprises and hidden dependency graphs

**Guardrails:**

- Compile shared assets into snapshots for local deterministic evaluation
- Fail closed when referenced assets are missing or incompatible
- Avoid live inheritance graphs, workflow-engine behavior, and release-orchestration drift

## Cross-Candidate Architecture Guidance

- Preserve `rulestead` as runtime/domain contract and `rulestead_admin` as the mounted operator companion
- Keep host auth, identity, tenant catalog truth, and observability ownership in the host app
- Prefer additive, explicit behaviours and `Ecto.Multi`-backed authored-state mutations over implicit magic
- Maintain deterministic local evaluation, explainability, auditability, and shareable URL-driven admin state
- Favor simple-mode defaults and progressive disclosure in the admin UI
