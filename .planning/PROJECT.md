# Rulestead

## What This Is

Rulestead is a batteries-included, Elixir-native feature-flag and remote-config platform for Phoenix, Plug, Ecto, LiveView, and Oban apps, shipped as sibling Hex packages: `rulestead` for runtime evaluation and `rulestead_admin` for the mounted operator UI. It gives Phoenix teams deterministic evaluation, explicit context, explainability, lifecycle hygiene, and a self-hosted admin plane that stays aligned with host-app auth and deployment workflows.

## Current State

- `v1.0.0` shipped on 2026-05-21 across Phases 26-28.
- The product now has a frozen public API boundary, canonical mounted-admin RBAC, and a proven Compose-backed end-to-end demo with Phoenix + Next.js/OpenFeature integration.
- `v1.1.0` shipped on 2026-05-23 across Phases 29-34, delivering the bounded tenancy seam, mounted-admin tenant scope, audit tenant provenance enforcement, public promotion-plan tenant-scope closure, compare preview-identity carry-through, and milestone auditability backfill without widening the product shape.
- No next milestone is active yet.

## Current Milestone: None Active

**Latest Milestone (v1.1.0) Complete:** Rulestead now ships the bounded tenancy contract across runtime, mounted admin, promotion replay/apply, compare drill-in identity, and audit provenance.

## Core Value

**Phoenix teams can safely gate, roll out, and explain runtime decisions — booleans, variants, and remote config — with 15-minute quickstart, deterministic evaluation, and a calm admin UI that operators, support, and SRE can all trust at 3am.**

Everything else can fail; this cannot. If the runtime evaluator is not fast, pure, deterministic, and explainable, nothing else matters.

## Strategic Arc (Future Milestones)

To provide a clear path forward for Rulestead as a "batteries included" feature-management platform, the following strategic arc captures the shipped path to GA and the open post-GA slot (detailed further in `.planning/research/EPIC_ARC.md`):

- **v0.6.0: Multi-environment Sync & Tenancy**
  - Focus: Environment promotion (Dev->Staging->Prod), diffing, GitOps export/import, and explicit multi-tenant helpers.
  - Value: Provide comprehensive tooling for complex SaaS environments and organizational rollouts, matching enterprise developer expectations.
- **v1.0.0: General Availability & RBAC**
  - Focus: Role-Based Access Control, API lockdown, security hardening, and complete reference documentation.
  - Value: A reliable, trusted, "done" system without feature creep that fulfills the Elixir-native platform promise.
- **Post-GA milestone: TBD**
  - Focus: Define the first post-GA roadmap deliberately instead of inheriting pre-GA assumptions wholesale.
  - Value: Avoid accidental scope carryover after the GA boundary.

## Release Posture

- First public Hex release planning was intentionally delayed until the platform had credible multi-environment and governance depth.
- Public distribution shape: publish both sibling packages together on Hex, with `rulestead_admin` documented as the mounted admin companion rather than a standalone control-plane product.
- General Availability shipped in `v1.0.0` on 2026-05-21.

### Active

- No active milestone requirements are defined right now.

## Next Milestone Goals

- Reassess the next JTBD gap deliberately now that the bounded tenancy seam is shipped.
- Lifecycle and ownership work remain the strongest follow-on candidate if no higher-value post-GA gap displaces them.
- Preserve the sibling-package release model and avoid tenant-partitioned storage or standalone admin drift.

### Out of Scope

- Broadening `rulestead_admin` beyond the mounted sibling-package design into a standalone control-plane product — explicitly disallowed by the current release design.

## Context

- `v0.1.0` through `v1.0.0` are now archived, covering the core runtime, admin UX, governance workflows, ecosystem seams, experimentation analytics, Redis-backed distribution, environment promotion, GitOps manifests, API lockdown, RBAC, and the GA demo stack.
- `v1.0.0` shipped across Phases 26-28, delivering the public API freeze, canonical RBAC, and the verified GA demo environment.
- `v1.1.0` shipped across Phases 29-34 as the first deliberate post-GA milestone, proving tenancy can stay bounded inside helper seams, reviewed-artifact validation, mounted-admin scope, public promotion replay/apply, and audit provenance without changing the release shape.
- The current focus is selecting the next milestone explicitly rather than auto-extending the roadmap.
- The project remains a linked-version, two-package monorepo.

## Constraints

- **Release design**: Keep the linked-version sibling-package release shape — the runtime and admin packages evolve together.
- **Security**: Maintain default-deny mutation security and strict audit logs.
- **Tenancy scope**: Ship explicit tenant-aware helpers and validation only; do not introduce tenant-partitioned authored storage, environment-per-tenant topology, or implicit all-tenant mutation behavior.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Make `v0.3.0` focused on Ecosystem Integration & Lifecycle Hygiene | Tackling tech debt via code references and providing OpenFeature APIs are major confidence boosters for large-scale enterprise adoption over experimenting/analytics right now. | Validated |
| Keep infrastructure health node-local by default and accept peer data only through an explicit host seam | Prevents the admin UI from implying undiscovered cluster health while preserving extension points for larger deployments. | Validated |
| Emit additive sync/invalidation telemetry aliases instead of renaming shipped runtime events | Preserves compatibility for existing telemetry consumers while satisfying the new observability contract. | Validated |
| Mount diagnostics inside the existing `rulestead_admin` router macro | Keeps diagnostics inside the current session, policy, and linked-version admin envelope. | Validated |
| Reuse the existing governed-action envelope for protected-environment promotion | Keeps approvals, scheduling, audit linkage, and operator review on one path instead of splitting promotion into a parallel workflow. | Validated |
| Model re-apply-version as a fresh forward promotion from immutable history | Preserves authored-truth semantics and avoids hidden rollback shortcuts that drift from compare/apply behavior. | Validated |
| Target the first public Hex release for after `v0.6.0`, not at `v0.1.0` and not only at `v1.0.0` | `v0.6.0` completed the multi-environment/GitOps story, while `v1.0.0` delivered the stronger GA-level stability promises. | Validated |
| Activate tenancy as `v1.1.0`, not as a silent Phase 25 carryover | Keeps the first post-GA milestone explicit, preserves current phase numbering, and aligns the roadmap with the current JTBD gap analysis. | Validated |

## Historical Context

<details>
<summary>Initialization snapshot</summary>

Rulestead closes the gap between FunWithFlags and heavier external platforms such as LaunchDarkly, Unleash, and Flagsmith by delivering multivariate values, ordered rules, deterministic bucketing, first-class explainability, lifecycle hygiene, and an intuitive self-hosted admin plane for Phoenix teams.

Future roadmap candidates identified before and during `v0.1.0` include governance flows, scheduled changes, webhooks, multi-tenant helpers, OpenTelemetry bridging, import/export expansion, and experimentation-focused capabilities.

3. New requirements emerged? -> Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? -> Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? -> Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `$gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check -> still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope -> reasons still valid?
